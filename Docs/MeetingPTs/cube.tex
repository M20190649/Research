:Title: Scatter plot with cubes
:Tags: 3D;Scatter plots;Manual
:Author: Christian Feuers√§nger
:Slug: scatter-cube-plot

This scatter plot example uses mark=cube* and z buffer=sort to place boxes
at each input coordinate. The color for each box is determined by point
meta={x+y+3}. The remaining keys are just for pretty printing.

The code is from the PGFPlots 1.10 manual: "4.6.4 Scatter Plots",
"Stacked Bar Plots and Nodes Near Coords".
