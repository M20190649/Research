	Drawbacks:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Has to store intermediate points to deal appropriately with `holes' in flocks.
		\item Join, subset elimination and consecutive checking at each timestamp.
		\item Expensive operations to maintain set of candidate flocks.
	\end{itemize}
	However, it has some interesting features to keep in mind:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Performs an early pruning of candidate flocks which do not touch the borders.
		\item Keeping tracking of candidates which touch the borders ease a parallel implementation. 
	\end{itemize}
