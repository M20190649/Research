	Pros:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Do not perform distance join at each timestamp.  Each transaction is associated just to the maximal disks it touches.  MP algorithms returns set of disks which happens `together'.
		\item Although still have to deal with consecutive checking, it is done just one time at the end of the window.
		\item Deal with subset elimination.
	\end{itemize}
	Cons:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Overlapping disks will introduce false flocks.  It will require an additional filter at the end of the window.
	\end{itemize}
